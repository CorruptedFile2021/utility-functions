# utility-functions

## Utility-functions is a python library made by me which contains multiple functions for you to use in your code to make it simpler and easier to read for others. 

#### these functions included in these libraries can be simple as getting the current operating system to adding glow to a image using `opencv-python`

#### Functions for other Libraries may also be added in the future, Currently These libraries are planned to have utility-functions written for them.

`opencv-python`
